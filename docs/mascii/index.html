<h2>The <tt>mascii</tt> translator</h2>

<table> <tr> <td valign="top" width="100%">

This page documents my years of failure trying to write interpreters
to ease my text writing such as LaTeX.  I'll begin with introducing
you to <tt>mascii</tt>.  Then I'll show you <tt>elproc</tt> and
finally I'll point to softwares that can do the job properly.  Come
with me on this adventure.

The word ``mascii'' stands for ``mathematical ascii.'' That's a few set
of rules that I use when I write mathematics that I intend to convert to
TeX or LaTeX.<br><br>

The program <tt>mascii</tt> does the translation. For example, the
program <tt>mascii</tt> can read ``let f(x) be a function from R -> R
such that f(x + y) = f(x) <*> f(y)'' and translate that to ``let $f(x)$
be a function from $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x + y) =
f(x) \cdot f(y)$.''<br><br>

This page does not describe the language that <tt>mascii</tt>
understands; this page just announces the program. To learn about
<tt>mascii</tt> translation capabilities, you must read the
documentation of the software included in the package of the
software.<br><br>

Because <tt>mascii</tt> makes a lot of mistakes, it is interesting to
use it slowly on small regions, as you write, so that you can learn
about its mistakes --- and learn to cope with them.  For example,
currently, if you write two fractions in the same
line, <tt>mascii</tt> will do the wrong thing, so it's convenient to
avoid writing two fractions on the same line.

But, before you know what to do, you must know what is
a <tt>mascii</tt> fraction.  A <tt>mascii</tt> fraction is any
sequence of bytes that matches the regular expression <br><br>

<center><tt>({[^}].*}[ ]*/[ ]*{[^}].*})</tt></center><br>

 which 1/2 does not match.  Not matching 1/2 is interesting because
quite often I want to write something like ``(x + 1)^{1/2}'' and I
don't want <tt>mascii</tt> to tell TeX that the ``1/2'' is supposed to
be a fraction in the shape ``numerator on top, a dash underneath, and
denominator on the bottom.''  Examples of fractions that get this
shape are <br><br>

<center><tt>{ numerator } / { denominator }. </tt></center><br>

Spaces in between things are allowed.

<h2>Interaction with the GNU EMACS</h2>

I like to use <tt>mascii</tt> from inside my GNU EMACS.  As I write a
paragraph, or a few paragraphs, I select a region that encloses the
text I wrote, then I press the key a combination of keys which causes
the GNU EMACS to feed that text to <tt>mascii</tt> and the GNU EMACS
replaces the region with the output of <tt>mascii</tt>. <br><br>

Notice the pictures. On the first, I have written a piece of text; on
the second, I've selected a region under the GNU EMACS. On the third,
I pressed a special key combination and the GNU EMACS has replaced the
region with the output from <tt>mascii</tt>.
